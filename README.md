This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically powered by JavaScript. Once the "Generate Password" button is clicked, the user will be prompted with 5 questions. The questions asked the user about the Character limits and the type of Letters, Numbers or Symbols they wish to use. The application will generate a unique password upon every request.
